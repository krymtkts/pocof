# Pocof

An interactive pipeline filtering Cmdlet for PowerShell written in F#.

A fork of [poco](https://github.com/jasonmarcher/poco) by yumura and jasonmarcher.
A port of [peco](https://github.com/peco/peco) for PowerShell.

## Motivation

To learn how to write Cmdlet in F#.
Also to add my own flavor to poco which I often use.

## Disclaimer

Still incomplete.
